# AI & ML Academy - Applied AI

Welcome to the AI & ML Academy (AIA) - Applied AI!

In this module, we’ll look at Applied AI services, including Form Recognizer, Metrics Advisor, Cognitive Search, Video Indexer, Personalizer, Anomaly Detector, and Power Virtual Agents. 

## Applied AI


### Form Recognizer 

Form Recognizer is an AI service that applies advanced machine learning to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents automatically and accurately. Turn documents into usable data and shift your focus to acting on information rather than compiling it.

## Hands-on Content

Each module contains several options for hands-on learning. In most cases, there are multiple options available designed to meet your specific skilling needs, from simple tutorial/demo content to more advanced workshops. We understand that some people may just want to see demos while others want to dive deep; most are somewhere in between. Use the content that best suits you!
